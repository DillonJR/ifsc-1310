<h1>Thoughts on Web Accessibility</h1>
<p>I think web accessibity is very important.
It not only allows those who otherwise would not have been able to use the web to use it, but also makes it easier for everyone else.
There are many interesting work-arounds that allow people to overcome thier navigational issues caused by disabilities. 
Without screen readers or keyboard navigation, a lot of sites would be unusable for a lot of people.
Accessibility is important because the more people that can contribute to something online, means more ideas, more work, more progress being done on all fronts. 
It allows people to start from
a level playing field as opposed to the physical world.</p>
<p>Accessibility is also very important as a business point. If people cannot easily use your site, you will lose traffic, which results in lost profits.
With the internet being able to connect people around the world, accessibity makes sure it can reach everyone. 
The more people contributing means more progress for humanity, as general shared information
may not have been gained if person x was not able to use your site because it was inaccessable. 
Accessibility is now also a social issue. If your site does not aid users that may typically have trouble, it can be viewed as not caring. If attention is brought to this it can have a negative impact on your site traffic and reputation.</p>
